###### In recent years, COVID19 has been a sudden obstacle upon everybodyâ€™s path. Both younger and older generations have been heavily impacted by COVID, in some way or another, leading to a state of crisis. This is a huge problem, but we, as a team, feel we help our communities and families. We may not be able to provide a cure to the virus, but we will do whatever else we can to save more lives. Such as stopping the spread, or at least slowing it down as much as we can. This virus has affected the lives of everybody in the world, and by enforcing rules, like social distancing and preventing people from touching their face, the spread of COVID-19 can be slowed, and the curve can be further flattened. Less lives lost. We cannot continue playing the blame game, pointing fingers. We can slow the spread of germs while simultaneously protecting ourselves. Contact tracing is also very heavy work for epidemiologists, and if we can provide technology that respects privacy and performs this task within stores, it would greatly ease the difficulty of the task at hand.
